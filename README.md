# GearTone
Algorhythmic music for iPad

A simple noise app to help you break your lease and lose a girl friend.

Let the computer create a melody with an algorithm!
This app combines that idea with gears which determine \
the relative timing and tone for each note.

1. Click on a gear to give it focus (marked with a star). \
2. Click on the tone name to launch the tone picker dialog.\
3. Adjust other params as necessary for beautiful effect.\
4. Move the gears around to build the tone bank.

The sliders at the bottom affect the music algorithm,\
where the 't' is the previous note number.
